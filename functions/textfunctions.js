/* ----------------------------------
getText() -> Returns a full text depending on data
NOTE: data MUST be constructed in the same property
order as specified on the relevant texts string, which should
be referenced in the beginning of the data function. 
For example, to retrieve the chastity text with no heavy bondage,
chastity, held by self, you should construct the data like this:
    data: {
        textarray: "texts_chastity", // the array to retrieve from
        textdata: { interactionuser, targetuser, ...c1, c2, etc } // see convertPronounsText function

        noheavy: true,
        chastity: true,
        key_self: true
    }
These properties are constructed dynamically with a for... in loop 
and then retrieved from the array using texts_chastity["noheavy"]["chastity"]["key_self"] 
to get the particular array of texts for that condition. 

THE PROPERTY ORDER IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE TEXT RETRIEVAL WORKS AS INTENDED.
